think of this as a bingo card for the next year. (_listed points are neither endorsements nor judgments._)

- by the end of the year **technical solutions** will be possible that we could not have imagined or thought of at the beginning of the year - _sounds obvious, but will be groundbreaking_
  - this includes - _but is not limited to_ - the world of AI
- **custom chipsets** from and for hyperscalers will bring incredible performance boost and efficiency (like [Google's Willow](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/))
  - power consumption and hard-to-achieve climate goals in the time of ai model trainings will be a big discussion point
- **two types of companies** will diverge even further: those fully endorsing AI as an enabling platform vs. those grumbling about governance and risks
- (private) **on-device AI models** will expand and thrive in sectors like robotics, IoT, healthcare
- [AI agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) will continue to be a buzzword, as companies (slowly) figure out their implementation and usefulness
- **layoffs** in hyper-inflated big tech companies will happen (to reduce costs and/or be automated by AI)
- there will likely be **more violence** or uprisings among inequality across the world and between societal groups
- **sovereignty** at macro- and micro-level will become an even bigger topic
  - **macro**: the big industries (US, APAC, EU) will increasingly work towards sovereign technology (chip manufacturing, software stack, data centers, etc.)
  - **micro**: more off-grid homes; private or shared (solar) power grids with battery systems; satellite internet; etc.
- the EU will hit **record-low growth** and economy numbers due to regulation, work ethic, and lack of startup support (see [eu-inc.org](https://www.eu-inc.org))
- AI-supported **private health checks** will massively expand (like [neko health](https://x.com/eldsjal/status/1863544777574097228))
- more **open source companies** will change their licensing due to investor pressure (from the _Redis_, _Elasticsearch_, _WordPress_ playbook)
- **bring your own cloud** (_BYOC_) will expand for SaaS companies
- more startups will **race to space** (rockets, micro satellites, orbit data centers)
- more companies will relocate from **high-cost metropolitan areas** to smaller, emerging semi-urban hubs
- following the continous **bad news avalanches**, more people will begin to tune out and ignore the news
- maybe we figure out a way for **more local communities** that go beyond the basic idea of yet another run club

ðŸš€ let's make the best of it!
