Getting the tooling of daily tasks right is super important. Working with fast, well-designed, and useful tools can unlock so much more productivity (or flow-state) ‚Äì and [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/?via=frytg) definitely ticks these boxes.

> **TLDR: Spotlight, but on steroids. It can do everything you're used to, but better and with more integrations.**

`‚åò + Space` opens the floating window on top of everything, that provides an entry point into all its commands. The following list includes some of my personal favorites, but certainly is not complete. The great thing about the app is that everyone can make it their own and use it in so many different ways.

## üôÉ Supercharged Emojis & GIFs

Before we're getting into the (actually useful) stuff, one of my favorite commands: Type `emo + Enter` and it shows me all emojis. Similar to the MacOS emoji browser, but nicer and _a lot faster!_. You can also add some emojis to your favorites and add custom keywords for faster access.

## ‚ú® AI chat

AI here, AI there,... But inside Raycast, this is actually useful. You do have the context of your environment (e.g. text that you copied), but don't need to open another tool or another website to do something with it.

Raycast (at least the [_Advanced AI_](https://www.raycast.com/pro?via=frytg) subscription) has the benefit, that it provides unified access to [lots of LLM models](https://www.raycast.com/blog/more-ai-models?via=frytg). Currently, it supports **Perplexity** (great for web searching), **Claude 3 & 3.5** from Anthropic (fast and currently my favorite), as well as the GPT models from **OpenAI**, **Llama**, and **Mixtral**.

The recent update also allows me to drag and drop images, PDFs, and more into the chat for further context or analysis.

## üìù Fix Spelling and Rewrite Things

No one's perfect, especially with commas and such. One can highlight text in literally any app, run "_Fix Spelling_" and let it make suggestions. I can either copy what I need or paste the whole block back into the original app.

There are also lots of presets for "_Change tone to {Casual, Professional, etc.}_". The great thing, in my opinion, is the ability to customize them all. Raycast comes with lots of presets out of the box, but they can all be edited. You can edit the prompt itself, along with the creativity and model settings for full flexibility.

## ‚ùì Talk to a Website

When they announced the [plugin for Chrome-browsers](https://www.raycast.com/browser-extension?via=frytg) I didn't think this would be as useful. I was wrong. It is super helpful to give the AI chat context and then ask things.

If I have a super long article and just want the highlights before (or instead of) reading it, I can run "_Summarize Website_" to use the browser context for a TLDR overview.

The only downside (so far) is that Google's Gemini AI models are not available in Raycast. I use them super often, since they can fully access YouTube and summarize or describe YouTube videos. I hope this will be available in the future.

## üìé Snippets

The ability to create snippets is fantastic for recurring blocks of text that one needs every day.

- `!day` returns me the current day in ISO format (`2024-01-01`), which is super useful for file names, notes, etc.
- `!log` returns the basic `console.log()` and positions the cursor right inside the brackets
- `!!log` provides quick access to our custom logging wrapper for JS
- `!shrug` types `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`
- ...and even more shortcuts for text snippets that are often being used

Using `!` as a prefix is my choice, you can literally set any keyword you like.

## üîç Search NPM

I always found [npmjs.org](https://www.npmjs.com) to be painfully slow. Having this extension allows me to search for packages from within Raycast and then open the correct link in the browser if I need to.

## üëç The Smaller Bits

- **My Schedule**: Quickly see the upcoming calendar events or even join meetings directly from the app.
- **Positioning Windows**: No, not Windows the OS, but actual app windows. Left half? Right two-thirds? Fullscreen? Everything is so quick.
- **Translate**: Quickly translate words or text between multiple languages or with LLMs.
- **Money**: How much was $200 in Euros again?
- **Conversions**: What is 6ft in the useable (I mean metric) system?
- **Quicklinks**: Kind of like bookmarks, but browser-independent and quickly accessible by typing.
- **[Store](https://www.raycast.com/store?via=frytg)**: There are so many extensions for all the popular apps like Linear, Notion, Arc, etc.

The only minor issue so far is that I'd love their main window to be slightly larger. Especially on a 5K monitor, it could be just a tad bigger to make larger text blocks easier to read.

## üöÄ Getting Started

It is also worth mentioning, that [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/?via=frytg) is a fully native macOS app, while the extensions by other developers are written in JavaScript/ TypeScript and can communicate back and forth with the UI. This makes the app feel super snappy and responsive.

If you want to give it a try: Go to [Raycast.com](https://www.raycast.com/?via=frytg) and click Download. They also have a 14-day Pro trial in the app to test out all the AI features.

The list of all extensions is available on the [/store](https://www.raycast.com/store?via=frytg) page or contribute yourself on [GitHub `raycast/extensions`](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/). You can also explore common snippets on [ray.so/snippets](https://ray.so/snippets/symbols), AI prompts on [ray.so/prompts](https://ray.so/prompts/code), or presets for the AI chat on [ray.so/presets](https://ray.so/presets/code).

Also, shoutout to their **hype squad** on [Twitter](https://x.com/raycastapp) and YouTube for content and tips about using the app.
