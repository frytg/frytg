# Tech Stack & What I Use

Consider this a continously-updated list of the tools, apps, and hardware I use for my work and personal projects.

## Tech

I'm a **Mac fanboy**, so this is being typed on a Mac mini (M1). When traveling a compact MacBook Air accompanies me.

#### Software

Most of the current projects are written in **Javascript** ([_Node.js_](https://nodejs.org/en) - with an eye on [_Bun_](https://bun.sh/)) (still want/ need to learn [_Rust_](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [_Go_](https://go.dev/). For frontend stuff I like using [_Vue.js_](https://vuejs.org/) along with [_Vite_](https://vitejs.dev/) for bundling.

For code editing/ **IDE** I'm currently trying to switch over to [_Zed_](https://zed.dev/), a new Rust-based super fast code editor. For features that they don't support (yet), I still use [_Visual Studio Code_](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

[_Raycast_](https://www.raycast.com/) is a super helpful tool for Mac, which I use for quick access to all kinds of things. The plugin to search [_NPM_](https://www.raycast.com/mrmartineau/search-npm) or [_Can I Use_](https://www.raycast.com/thomaslombart/can-i-use) are must-haves. The [_GitHub_](https://www.raycast.com/raycast/github) plugin also saves a lot of time.

For **Browsers** I mostly use [_Arc_](https://arc.net/), a customizable Chromium browser on desktop and [_Safari_](https://www.apple.com/safari/) on mobile.

**Search** on all browsers has been replaced by [_DuckDuckGo_](https://duckduckgo.com/). I like their privacy policy and the search results are less cluttered and cleaner. Toggling location-based search results is also a nice feature.

[_1Password_](https://1password.com/), [_Figma_](https://www.figma.com/), [_Apple Music_](https://music.apple.com/), _Proton_ (both [Mail](https://proton.me/mail) and [VPN](https://protonvpn.com/)) are also frequent apps.

[_Obsidian_](https://obsidian.md/) is a fantastic tool to organize notes and thoughts in Markdown. I like their approach over _Notion_, since files are local ([and therefore owned!](https://stephango.com/file-over-app)) and can easily be transferred or synced.

After the shutdown of _Tweetbot_ (rest in peace), I switched over to [_Ivory_](https://tapbots.com/ivory/) and my own Mastodon instance [beoriginal.social](https://beoriginal.social/).

Work and development-wise I'm a big fan of [_Scaleway_](https://www.scaleway.com/), with their EU-based public cloud platform. For all the other stuff [_Google Cloud Platform_](https://cloud.google.com/) and [_AWS_](https://aws.amazon.com/) are the usual options. CDN is mostly [_Bunny_](https://bunnycdn.com/) or [_Fastly_](https://www.fastly.com/). [_Terraform_](https://www.terraform.io/) is great to make infrastructure reproducible and abstract bad cloud UIs.

## EDC

Stuff that I always carry with me includes a [_Whoop_](https://join.whoop.com/3AC604) fitness and recovery tracker, a pair of _AirPods Pro_, a _Leatherman_ multitool, and _Freitag_ wallet.

## This Website

While switching over from [_Jekyll_](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [_Hugo_](https://gohugo.io/), I also rewrote most of it to make it as minimal and fast as possible. Most pages are written in pure Markdown with custom attributes. The layout is some bare-bones HTML structure with custom elements for pages and the blog.

The style is based on [_Tailwind CSS_](https://tailwindcss.com/), with some pre-processing to bundle the [_Inter_](https://rsms.me/inter/) font using [_Vite_](https://vitejs.dev/). The final static assets are hosted on [_Bunny CDN_](https://bunnycdn.com/). The source code is publicly hosted on [_GitHub_](https://github.com/frytg/frytgdigital).
