# Tech Stack & What I Use

Consider this a continously-updated list of the tools, apps, and hardware I use for my work and personal projects.

## This Website

While switching over from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), I also rewrote most of it to make it as minimal and fast as possible. Most pages are written in pure Markdown with custom attributes. The layout is some bare-bones HTML structure with custom elements for pages and the blog.

The style is based on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), with some pre-processing to bundle the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) font using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The final static assets are hosted on [Bunny CDN](https://bunnycdn.com/). The source code is publicly hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/frytg/frytgdigital).
