# Me, on Social Media

I definitely was a big fan of the bird network (Twitter) in the beginning, but recent policy changes made it hard to justify using it.

At the same time, federated social networks (Fediverse) like Mastodon and Bluesky are growing and becoming more interesting.

**Here's where you can find me nowadays:**

🐘 **Mastodon**: [`@FRYTG@beoriginal.social`](https://beoriginal.social/@FRYTG) - currently my favorite network, with a good mix of tech/ developer community and personal stuff

🦋 **Bluesky**: [`@frytg.digital`](https://bsky.app/profile/frytg.digital) - good and growing; fairly good twitter replacement

👨🏼‍💻 **GitHub**: [`@frytg`](https://github.com/frytg) - home to all my development + open source projects as well as work-related stuff

📸 **Instagram**: [`@dan.frytg`](https://www.instagram.com/dan.frytg) - stories and photos from day-to-day life

💬 **Threads**: [`@dan.frytg`](https://www.threads.net/@dan.frytg/) - quite similar to Instagram, but with a bit more focus on text

💌 **Good 'ol email**: [`contact@frytg.com`](mailto:contact@frytg.com) - if email is your thing

🚴🏼 **Strava**: [_`Dan`_](https://www.strava.com/athletes/7693180) - cycling and sports-related stuff
