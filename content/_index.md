# Hello, I'm Daniel,

or _Dan_ for short.
{.text-3xl .title-style}

I am an **Audio Cloud & Innovation Manager** at [SWR Audio Lab](https://www.swr.de/unternehmen/audiolab/index.html). Read more below about my current work and projects.

In the past, I have also worked on live and film productions for local and international companies, events, and TV & radio stations.

## Currently

At the moment my work focuses on the improvement of [ARD Audiothek](https://www.ardaudiothek.de/), a platform for audio content from public broadcasters in Germany. I especially work on the integration and improvement of ARD Audiothek on voice assistants and platforms right now.

Additionally, we're working on the [responsible integration](https://www.swr.de/unternehmen/ki-guidelines-100.pdf) of AI into our internal and external products and services.

Our team also manages the apps for _SWR_'s radio stations, like the popular [_SWR3_](https://www.swr3.de/app) mobile apps for iOS and Android. For these apps I also built the backend infrastructure, providing live meta data, podcasts, and all other content through our own central _SWR Radiohub_ APIs, serving billions of API requests per month.

When not working you can often find me in **nature** or on a **bike**. I also enjoy photography, design, listening to music & podcasts and discovering new stuff on the internet. Climate change and sustainability are also important topics for me.

## Past

Previously I also got to work on some exciting projects:

- **SWR3 Elchbot**, a chatbot for the popular radio station SWR3, which was also nominated for [_Deutscher Radiopreis 2019_](https://www.swr3.de/wir/deutscher-radiopreis-2019-swr3-dreimal-nominiert-100.html) in the category _Best Innovation_.
- **Websites and Blogs**, like _corona.karlsruhe.de_ ([still available on archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20230301114757/https://corona.karlsruhe.de/)), which served as a central information platform for the city of Karlsruhe during the COVID-19 pandemic with millions of visitors.
- **Press photography** for numerous events and agencies, with publications in _dpa_, _ka-news_, _Spiegel Online_, _n-tv_, _RP Online_ and more.
- **Virtual Trade Fair Platform** for [Liveline Connect](https://liveline-connect.de/), which is beeing used by several internal trade fairs for their digital or hybrid events [[1]](https://www.intergeo.de/en/news/digital-interaktiv-international-intergeo-digital-mit-erfolgreicher-premiere).
- **Live and film productions** with [Knappe1a Productions](https://www.knappe1a.de/) and others.
