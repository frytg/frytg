# Hello, I'm Daniel

I am an Audio Cloud & Innovation Manager at [SWR](https://lab.swr.de/). In the past, I have also worked on live and film productions for local and international companies, television, events, and radio.s

## Currently

My work at the moment focuses on the improvement of [ARD Audiothek](https://www.ardaudiothek.de/), a platform for audio content from public broadcasters in Germany. There I especially work on the integration into voice assistants and platforms.

We also manage the current radio apps for _SWR_, like the popular [SWR3](https://www.swr3.de/app) mobile apps for iOS and Android. For these apps I also built the backend infrastructure, providing live meta data, podcasts, and all other content through our own _SWR Radiohub_ APIs.
