				I am working for üá©üá™ German public broadcaster
				<a href="https://swr.de" target="_blank">SWR</a>, where I make cool projects around
				voice assistants, radio, apps and the cloud happen.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally I'm also working on a number of other projects. Most recently I've been
				helping to transform real-life events into hybrid or digital experiences.

				Grown up with the internet, trained in television, working in radio and producing for
				live events, there's no denying that working across platforms is important to me.

				The main fields I'm passionate about involve web development, film production, graphic
				design, live productions as well as Social Media and Community Management. As you can
				see, that's a lot of digital stuff, hence the name <b>FRYTG digital</b>.

					<strong>Websites</strong> - Even though third-party platforms are growing, a

					With a growing number of events on the platform, a key milestone was the digital

					with its digital version
